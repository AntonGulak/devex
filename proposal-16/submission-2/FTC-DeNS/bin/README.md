You can put custom version of `tonos-cli`, `tvm_linker` or `solc` 
here for them to be used by the scripts instead of the system ones,
or if system ones do not exist at all.

`stdlib_sol.tvm` is used for linking and may be updated to newer 
version by author, although that is not required and is not very
recommended in order to maintain the same bytecode if there are no
changes.
